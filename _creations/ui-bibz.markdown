### Library Ui Bibz is based on one component.

![Ui Bibz Logo](http://hummel.link/images/portfolio/ui-bibz/ui-bibz-logo-without-border.gif)

All components inherit from component element. No need to write HTML, CSS or Javascript. Component are based on Bootstrap and all new version are managed by Ui Bibz. The framework is written with Ruby for Ruby on Rails.

A component will always write the same way even if HTML, CSS or Javascript code change. You can find all components of Bootstrap 4 and more.
